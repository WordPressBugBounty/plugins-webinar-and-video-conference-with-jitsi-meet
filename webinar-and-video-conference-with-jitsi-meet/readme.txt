== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How quickly can I get started? =
Activate the plugin on your site and begin within minutes. Watch this [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MckVL389lpc).

= Does the plugin support Gutenberg and Elementor? =
Yes, you can create meetings as Gutenberg blocks and Elementor widgets using the FlexMeeting plugin.

= Is there any shortcode? =
Yes. With the shortcode `[jitsi-meet-wp/]`, you can embed a meeting where Gutenberg is not available.

= Can I create a custom domain? =
You can create a branded meeting URL using the custom domain feature available through JaaS or a self-hosted Jitsi setup.

= Is FlexMeeting safe? =
The plugin uses Jitsi Meet which provides encrypted communication, and FlexMeeting works with those features to help maintain privacy while hosting online meetings.

= I want a refund for my purchase of the plugin. What is the procedure? =
We have a 14-day refund policy. Please email support@wppool.dev explaining why you would like a refund.

= What is Frontend Meeting Creation? =
It allows users to create and manage meetings directly from the front end—no admin access or technical steps required.

= What does the Whiteboard Integration do? =
It enables visual collaboration by allowing participants to sketch, draw diagrams, and share ideas in real time during a meeting.

= Can I use self-hosted Jitsi Meet with this plugin? =
Yes. You can use Jitsi free at [https://meet.jit.si](https://meet.jit.si), JaaS at [https://jaas.8x8.vc](https://jaas.8x8.vc), or any self-hosted Jitsi Meet instance with the plugin, depending on your requirements.

= Can I use my branded logo and domain? =
Yes. You can apply your own branding and domain when using JaaS or a self-hosted Jitsi setup.

= Can I record the meeting? =
Recording is available in the premium version of the plugin and also requires a JaaS 8×8 subscription.

= How many active users do we have? =
On the free version, you can have 25 monthly active users. JaaS Premium plans offer additional capacity (e.g., 300, 1500, or 3000 active users depending on the plan). JaaS may update their limits, and FlexMeeting acts as a bridge between your site and the Jitsi service.

Participants are generally limited to 500 per meeting on JaaS; to increase this limit, you must upgrade your JaaS plan.

Self-hosting has no fixed meeting limit—it depends on your server resources. Jitsi suggests around 75 participants for stable performance, but higher numbers may be possible with sufficient infrastructure.

= Where will my meeting recordings be stored? =
Recordings can be stored on Dropbox when using JaaS Premium. JaaS may use its own connected storage services. Recording requires a JaaS 8×8 subscription.

= Can I do live streaming? =
Yes. Live streaming to platforms like YouTube is supported when using the appropriate JaaS plan.
